# Expense Tracker (Beginner Python Project)

## Project Overview
Welcome to the **Expense Tracker** project! This is a beginner-level command-line application built to help you manage and track daily expenses. It allows you to view, add, edit, and save expenses in various categories (like food, travel, etc.). This project is designed as an excellent way to practice fundamental Python concepts, such as:

- Working with user input
- File handling (reading/writing JSON files)
- Basic data structures (lists, dictionaries)
- Error handling (to manage user mistakes)

By building this project, you'll improve your understanding of Python while creating a practical tool.
