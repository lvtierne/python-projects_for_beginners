# Weather Data Analysis (Beginner Python Project)

## Overview

**Weather Data Analysis** is a beginner-friendly Python project that fetches real-time weather data for a specified city using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). The project allows users to store this data in a CSV file and perform analysis to calculate averages, maximum and minimum temperatures, and humidity levels.

## Features

- Fetch weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Store weather data in a CSV file for easy access and manipulation.
- Analyze the stored weather data, including:
  - Average temperature
  - Maximum and minimum temperatures
  - Humidity levels

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lvtierne/python-projects_for_beginners.git
   cd python-projects_for_beginners/weather_data_analysis
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas
   ```
3. **Get Your API Key**: Sign up for a free account at OpenWeatherMap to obtain your API key.

## Usage

### Fetch Weather Data
- Run the weather_data.py script to fetch weather data for specified city:
   ```bash
   python weather_data.py
   ```
- You will be prompted to enter the name of the city you want to fetch the weather data for.

### Example:
  ```bash
  Enter the city name: New York
  Fetching weather data for New York...
  Weather data saved to weather_data.csv
  ```

### Analyze Weather Data
- To analyze the weather data stored in weather_data.csv, you can use a separate script (you may need to implement this if it's not already included in your project):
```bash
python analyze_weather.py
```

## API Key Setup
- In your weather_data.py script, replace the placeholder for the API key with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key. The relevant section of the code should look like this:
```bash
API_KEY = 'your_openweathermap_api_key_here'
```

## Data Analysis
- After fetching the weather data, you can perform various analyses such as calculating the average temperature, maximum and minimum values, and humidity. Make sure you have the necessary logic implemented in your analysis script.
